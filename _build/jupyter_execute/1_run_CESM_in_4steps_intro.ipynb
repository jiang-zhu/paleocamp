    "\n",
    "1. `--case`: the name and directory path of your case (_your Production Control Room_)  \n",
    "  - Setting case to `~/cases/case01` will make a simulation called `case01` and it will be located in `~/cases`\n",
    "  - We use `case01` for simplicity, but here is the [CESM case naming conventions](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/naming-conventions)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `--compset`: the CESM component set that you’d like to use.\n",
    "  - CESM2 components can be combined in numerous ways to carry out various scientific experiments. A particular mix of components, along with component-specific configuration and/or namelist settings is called a component set or `compset`.\n",
    "  - `B1850` means fully coupled preindustrial control including active atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, etc.\n",
    "  - `E1850` means coupled preindustrial control with active atmosphere and land but a slab ocean (no ocean dynamics).\n",
    "  - `F1850` means atmosphere/land-only simulation with fixed sea-surface temperature and sea ice cover.\n",

    "3. `--res`: the resolution that you’d like to use.\n",
    "  - `f19_g17`: ~2° atmosphere/land and ~1° ocean/sea ice.\n",
