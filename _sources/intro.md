## Prerequisites
The following notebooks contain very simple introdution to Unix, Python, Jupyter, and NCAR resources and access.
* 0_Prerequisites_1_unix.ipynb
* 0_Prerequisites_2_python_jupyter.ipynb
* 0_Prerequisites_3_ncar_account_jupyterhub.ipynb

---
## Overall learning objectives
* Know basic structure of CESM as a software
* Learn to set up and validate simple experiments with CESM
* Learn to use Python/Jupyter Nobebooks for analyzing and visualizing model output in netcdf, and for assessing model-data agreement.

## Three main modules
* An introduction to CESM
* Exercises on running CESM preindustrial control and mid-Holocene simulations
* Exercises on analyzing CESM output with NCAR JupyterHub

## Optional advanced modules
* An example on how to set up more complicated paleoclimate simulation (CESM2-PaleoCalibr LGM)
* Examples on how to use available simulations and reanalysis data on the NCAR machines
