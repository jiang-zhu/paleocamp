## Overall learning objectives
* Know basic structure of CESM as a software
* Learn to set up and validate simple experiments with CESM
* Learn to use Python/Jupyter Nobebooks to analyze and visualize model output and assess model-data agreement.


---
## Three main modules
* An introduction to CESM
* Exercises on running CESM preindustrial control and mid-Holocene simulations
* Exercises on analyzing CESM output with NCAR JupyterHub


## Optional modules
* An example on how to set up more complicated paleoclimate simulation (CESM2-PaleoCalibr LGM)
* Examples on how to use available simulations and reanalysis data on the NCAR machines

## Prerequisites
Very simple introdution to Unix, Python, Jupyter, and NCAR resources and access.
